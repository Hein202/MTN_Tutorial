    <h1>Global Warming</h1>
    <p>Global warming refers to the long-term increase in Earth's average surface temperature, primarily due to human activities such as burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrial processes. These activities release greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O) into the atmosphere. These gases trap heat from the sun, leading to a gradual warming of the planet.</p>
    <p>The consequences of global warming are extensive and far-reaching. They include rising sea levels due to the melting of polar ice caps and glaciers, more frequent and severe weather events like hurricanes, droughts, and heatwaves, disruptions to ecosystems and biodiversity, and impacts on agriculture, water resources, and human health.</p>
    <p>Addressing global warming requires concerted efforts at both individual and collective levels. This includes reducing greenhouse gas emissions by transitioning to renewable energy sources, adopting sustainable land-use practices, enhancing energy efficiency, and implementing policies and regulations to mitigate climate change. Additionally, adaptation strategies are needed to cope with the changes that are already underway. International cooperation and collaboration are crucial for effectively combating global warming and safeguarding the future of our planet.</p>
